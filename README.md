# Language Learning App V2

## This project exists publicly only to document my progress. It is still in the development phase and is currently not usable outside of my local environment. If you try to run it locally, it will not work correctly due to the missing env file.

This project builds on the functionality built for [version 1](https://github.com/TimFau/language-learning-app). Goals include:
- Integrating backend functionality with Directus, including:
    - Account functionality
    - The ability to create, manage, and delete user lists within the app
    - The ability to import lists from Google sheets and save them in the app's backend
- Decoupling from relying solely on Google Sheets for getting and storing data.
- Switching to Typescript as a learning experience and for ease of maintenance
- Creating a better base application that I can use to implement various other functionality I have been wanting to build

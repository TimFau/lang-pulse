# SCSS Variable Validation

When making any modifications or additions to SCSS files, it is mandatory to verify that all SCSS variables (e.g., `$primary-color`, `$spacing-lg`) are defined in the project's global variables file.

The single source of truth for all SCSS variables is `[variables.scss](mdc:src/css/partials/base/variables.scss)`.

Before considering any task involving SCSS as complete, you must cross-reference your changes against this file to ensure no undefined variables are used. This prevents CSS compilation errors and maintains consistency with the established design system.

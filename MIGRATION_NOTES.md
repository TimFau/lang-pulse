# Migration from Create React App to Vite

## Completed Steps

1. Created Vite configuration files:
   - `vite.config.ts`
   - `tsconfig.node.json`
   - `index.html` (root)
   - `src/vite-env.d.ts`

2. Updated package.json scripts to use Vite:
   - `dev` - for development
   - `build` - for production build
   - `preview` - to preview production build

3. Updated React code:
   - Modernized React imports in index.tsx
   - Updated environment variable format (from `process.env.REACT_APP_*` to `import.meta.env.VITE_*`)
   - Removed service worker

4. Created a script to fix MUI imports by removing trailing slashes

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Import Errors**: Several imports are still not being resolved correctly:
   - `queries` and `hooks` imports need to be updated to use the correct path aliases
   - You may need to update additional imports

2. **Path Aliases**: Vite path aliases have been configured but some files might still need adjustments

3. **Environment Variables**: You need to create a new `.env.local` file with the following content:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE=your_api_endpoint_here
   ```
   This replaces the previous `.env` file with `REACT_APP_*` variables.

4. **SASS Deprecation Warnings**: There are several SASS deprecation warnings that could be addressed in the future.

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining import errors
2. Migrate SASS @import to @use and @forward syntax (optional)
3. Update CSS modules if used (check for .module.css/scss files)
4. Test all routes and functionality
5. Verify that the production build works correctly

## Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

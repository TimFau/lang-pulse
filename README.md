This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project is still in development phase, but works

## To test the initial (less developed) version of this project go to https://codepen.io/TimFau/pen/wLOLzq


Idea came after seeing this : https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/b81zqh/using_google_sheets_to_translate_batches_of_words/

I liked having a list to add all the words I wanted to learn, but wanted a way to quiz myself on them.
